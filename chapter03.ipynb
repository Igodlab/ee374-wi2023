    "# The Transaction\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Coins\n",
    "- Now that we have covered the basics - money is a social construct and we agreed on owr ctypto primitives $\\rightarrow$ we can create owr own money:\n",
    "    - As long as it is difficult to forge and everyone agrees on *who owns what*\n",
    "- We'll refer to transactions as coins passing from hand-to-hand\n",
    "    - Transactions are boxes were transitions occur and arrows represent value moving ie. returning/changing owner\n",
    "    - Illustrations put names on owners but in reality these are pub-key hashes not legal identities\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Multiple outputs\n",
    "- Dangling arrows are **Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs)** any other arrow that points to a transaction block is already spent\n",
    "- Similarly to the cash system, if one has a 1000 bill and wants to spend only 50 to buy a book but keep the other 950, then they must split the phisical bill into 50 bucks + change. *UTXO*s function in the same way\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3 Multiple inputs\n",
    "- Multiple inputs can converge into a transaction block to aggregate for making larger payments\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.4 Conservation law\n",
    "- With the exception of minting new tokens (which have a genesis where everything gets created in one transtaction) all other transactions must obey a *conservation law*:\n",
    "    - value comming from all inputs must equal the value comming from all outputs (minus a tx fee): \n",
    "    - **Definition 11** (Conservation law). *Given a transaction $\\text{tx}$, we say that it obeys the Conservation Law if*: $\\sum_{\\text{in}\\in\\text{tx.ins}}\\text{in.v}=\\sum_{\\text{out}\\in\\text{tx.outs}}\\text{out.v}+\\text{fees}$\n",
    "    \n",
    "### 3.5 Outpoints\n",
    "- All transactions have a unique identifier $\\text{txid}$, obtained by hashing all of its transaction data ie. I/Os\n",
    "    - All inputs are just outputs being spent, thus we can reference ouputs with a tuple containing $(\\text{txid}, \\text{idx})$ ie. from which previous transaction block $\\text{txid}$ does its input number $\\text{idx}$ come from?\n",
    "    \n",
    "### 3.6 The UTXO Set\n",
    "- The whole history of payments forms a transaction **(DAG) Directed Acyclic Graph** (an append-only graph)\n",
    "    - The diagram is simplified for conciseness (not showing owners or values)\n",
    "    - Key thing is to highlight that UTXOs are the current state of the Ledger, all UTXO's form the **UTXO set** in the Ledger at a particular time\n",
    "    - When a payment occurs a party creates a new transaction and broadcasts it to the network\n",
    "    - Each node in the network appends new transtactions and stores the whole transaction graph ie. everyone knows *who owns what* by looking at their local UTXO set\n",
    "    - To know *how much* a particular party has, he must collect and sum the value of all of the UTXOs (from the current UTXO set) marked with a pub-key whose respective private-key is in his possesion \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/ch036-dag-utxo-set.png\" width=\"60%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.7 Transaction signatures\n",
    "- For a transaction to be valid, its inputs must point to outputs whose spending has been authorized by their rightful owner. \n",
    "    - This can be done by signing the new transaction data using the secret key that corresponds to the public key annotated on the previous output being spent.\n",
    "    - Upon creation, a transaction must have each of its inputs $\\text{in}_1,\\ldots,\\text{in}_n$ signed by his owner's private-keys $\\sigma_1, \\ldots, \\sigma_n$ (created by $sk_1,\\ldots,sk_n$ and verifiable by $pk_1,\\ldots,pk_n$), respectively\n",
    "    \n",
    "### 3.8 Transaction creation\n",
    "- The general chronological order to create a new transaction is: *(i)* sender request the receiver his pub key through some off-chain means. *(ii)* sender picks his UTXO outpoints to spend from then signs everything ($\\sigma=sk+pk$ for each) and creates a new transaction with the outputs containing receiver's pub key and value being trasferred. *(iii)* collects all data in previous step into a message. *(iv)* for each UTXO outpoint sender signs with private key and *(v)* broadcasts the transaction to the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.9 Transaction format\n",
    "- A concrete example of a transaction block (shown below) is a collection of \n",
    "    - 1. List of inputs $(\\text{txid, idx})$ - each element is an outpoint: tuple of an existing UTXO hash $\\text{txid}$ and its output number $\\text{idx}$\n",
    "    - 2. List of outputs- each element is a pair of pub key (receiver/owner of the output) and value amount (integer w/ comma shifted to avoid floating point operations)\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.0470588); padding:10px 0;font-family:monospace; font-family:monospace\">\n",
    "{<br>\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;inputs: [<br>\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{ outpoint: ( \"cc6a...d169\", 0 ), sig: \"13f1...bc79...8c0b\" }<br>\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{ outpoint: ( \"3a64...58a0\", 3 ), sig: \"680b...ac27...eae8\" }<br>\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;],<br>\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;outputs: [<br>\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{ pk: \"36de...6a69\", amount: 7400900000000 }<br>\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{ pk: \"f71c...6630\", amount: 2710200000000 }<br>\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{ pk: \"d916...e467\", amount: 1535700000000 }<br>\n",

    "### 3.10 Transaction validation\n",
    "- Validating an incoming transaction means that nodes update their transaction history graph. The process goes as follows:\n",
    "    - *Transaction validation* ie. checking that a particular transaction is rightfully spending the crypto that it is claiming.\n",
    "        - 1. Tx arrives at the door of a receiver for the 1st time, for each input he resolves the respective outpoint\n",
    "            - (a) checks that outpoint is in his current UTXO set\n",
    "            - (b) retrieves the value amount and pub key from outpoint\n",
    "            - (c) checks that a signature on the new Tx data verifies using the pub key of the outpoint\n",
    "        - 2. Ckecks that conservation law holds (or that its a valid coinbase/first minted transaction)\n",
    "        - 3. Removes the outpoints from the current UTXO set\n",
    "        - 4. Adds the new outpoints of the Tx to its latest UTXO set\n",
    "    - *Gossips* the new updated UTXO set to the network\n",
    "- Let's linger on point 1.a). there since its crucial to check ownership of crypto, and double spending. If we face the scenario where a new Tx is NOT in the current UTXO set:\n",
    "    - $\\mathcal{A}$ created a Tx trying to spend from an nonexistent outpoint\n",
    "    - *benign reason* - a timing/racing problem ie. $\\text{tx}_1$ is created first, then $\\text{tx}_2$ spends some outpoint from $\\text{tx}_1$. However, the verifier may recieve $\\text{tx}_1, \\text{tx}_2$ in a different order that they were send. In this scenario the validator MUST reject $\\text{tx}_2$ because he cannot know if a prevoius $\\text{tx}_1$ exists in the first place (could be $\\mathcal{A}$ attempting to spend a non-existing outpoint as above) \n",
    "    - *Double spending* - from the point above could also be the case that the output from $\\text{tx}_1$ exists but was immediately removed because it's been spend already and the new $\\text{tx}_2$ is trying to **double spend** it. In this scenario the validator must reject it\n",
    "        - **Definition 12** (Double spending). *In the UTXO model a $\\text{tx}$ is a* **double spend** *or a conflicting transaction with another transaction $\\text{tx}^\\prime\\neq\\text{tx}$, if $\\text{tx}$ and $\\text{tx}^\\prime$ both have some outpoint in their inputs that is the same ie.* $\\exists i,j\\in\\mathbb{N}:\\text{tx.ins}[i]\\text{.outpoint}=\\text{tx}^\\prime\\text{.prime}[j]\\text{.outpoint}$\n",
    "- Transactions broadcast from different parts of the network may arrive in a different order in other parts of the network. As different nodes on the network see different transactions at different times, each node may have a different opinion on what their current UTXO set is. This can lead to race conditions, which we tackle in  the next chapter."
