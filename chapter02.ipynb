    "    - thus, **collisions** are inevitable, some algorithms to find the problematic inputs are\n",
    "        - start feeding inputs to $H$, starting w/ $x=0$ and going up to $2^\\kappa-1$, if there hasn't been a collision until then $\\Rightarrow$ we are certain that the next input will yield a collision\n",
    "        - Brute force search, runs in exponential time $2^{2\\kappa}$ where we use two for loops one for $x_i$ and the other for $x_j$ aiming to find $(i,j)\\wedge H(x_i)=H(x_j)$\n",

    "- As we can see there is some deductive hierarchy in strength of theorems:\n",
    "    - **Theorem 3** (Collision Resistance $\\Rightarrow$ 2nd Preimage Resistance). *If a hash function $H$ is collision resistant, then it is 2nd-preimage resistant*\n",
    "    - **Theorem 4** (2nd Preimage Resistance $\\Rightarrow$ Preimage Resistance). *If a hash funciton $H$ is 2nd-preimage resistant, then it is preimage resistant*\n",
    "    \n",
    "- *Intuitive soft proofs*:\n",
    "    - Proof of Theorem 3 (by contradiction) - suppose another $\\mathcal{A}$ that can break $H$ in 2nd-preimage and serves $\\mathcal{A}^\\prime$ in its mission to break collision. First, $\\mathcal{A}^\\prime$ chooses $x_1\\sim P_\\text{uniform}$ from the message space and then hands it to $\\mathcal{A}$ who, based in our assumption, overcomes Definition 7 w/ non-negligible prob, producing an $x_2$ such that $x_1\\neq x_2 \\wedge H(x_1)=H(x_2)$. Then, returns this output to $\\mathcal{A}^\\prime$ who produces the final output $(x_1,x_2)$. If $\\mathcal{A}$ breaks 2nd-preimage w/ non-negligible prob then $\\mathcal{A}^\\prime$ will break collision w/ non-negligible prob as well. However, because both $\\mathcal{A},\\mathcal{A}^\\prime$ are PPT this contradicts the assumption that $H$ is collision resistant $\\square$\n",

    "#### Gossiping with hashses\n",
    "- Collision resistance ensures that objects are uniquely *content-addressible*\n",
    "- Hashes are so useful that allow to advertise unique objects without revealing its contents\n",
    "- In the gossiping process, instead of sending the whole object to peers it is more efficient to advertise its hash (*objectid*)\n",
    "    - If a peer is already aware of the object, then they can simply ignore it. If not they can request the object through its *objectid* and verify its hash upon delivery\n",
    "    - Moreover, gossiping w/ hashes allows anonymity ie. $B$ doesn't have a way of knowing if object $O$ was generated by $A$'s IP addr or simply relayed.\n",

    "#### Hash security \n",
    "- Because collision resistance is the stronger resistance proof its the only requisite to call a hash function *cryptographically secure*\n",

    "### 2.2 Signatures\n",

    "#### Public key cryptograpy\n",
    "- Lets state the distinction between identity in legacy and blockchain systems\n",
    "    - *Legacy* - identity is tied to a person as info in the government's database and has a correspondent physical card (passport) that is accepted\n",
    "    - *Blockchain* - identity can be *pseudonymous* and an actor can have multiple ones. Idenity is a tuple of a private $sk$ and public key $pk$\n",
    "        - for any identity there is a tuple of uniquely related $sk$ and $pk$ \n",
    "        - given a private key, it is easy to get the respective public key. Given a public key, it is hard to get the respective private key\n",

    "    - A receiver of message $m$ can invoke a boolean function $\\operatorname{Ver}(pk, m, \\sigma)$ to check the veracity of the message and if was truly produced by the sender (whose pub key is $pk$)\n",

    "- **Forgery** is when the adversary succeeds in breaking the cryptographic scheme. Lets describe scenarios w/ (incremental) power \n",
